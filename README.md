ErrandPay_Assessment_CustomerMicroService

This microservice is to help in the creation of users/customers and roles.

The CustomerController has endpoints that are all accessible by the superAdmin

I made the creation of an admin to be anonymous so as to be able to create an superAdmin and also to make the use of the program easier.

Each enpoint returns the name of the user/customer and their role
